<p>Growing up life was not easy.Was not that good at studies and when you are not good in studies you have the least importance in your social group.But often found strength in God which eventually changed my life.But hhttps://wallpapercave.com/wp/SYIOryg.jpgere comes the big problem the moment you say the word religion it becomes a controversy.The thing which we forget is that though we have several different opinions of who God may or may not be at the end of we will all have the same God.So the greatest gift which I can give to the pain filled world is truth.Today there is an immense and untapped potential in technologies like data science,machine learning ,artificial intelligence which can help us reconstruct the lost history.So have a desire to use this knowledge to lead a life of purpose.
